### STROUD AGAINST RACISM POLITICAL PARTY AND CANDIDATES PLEDGE

WE PLEDGE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECOGNISING AND UNLEARNING RACISM AND WHITE SUPREMACY within our organisation and associated activist networks. We accept that this is a complicated process and we will work hard in good faith to see it through.

WE PLEDGE TO BE RESPONSIBLE BOTH AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A PARTY OR ORGANISATION to hold our candidates, representatives and spokespeople to account when sharing views, content, images or messaging that can be understood to be racist, however accidentally or indirectly this might be.

WE PLEDGE TO FOCUS ON EDUCATION WITHIN OUR PARTY OR ORGANISATION and to offer opportunities for our members to grow and unlearn any racist or unconscious biases they may have, without shame or blame.

WE PLEDGE TO FOSTER AN ENVIRONMENT OF OPEN, HONEST, SOMETIMES UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS within our spaces and to always confront racism when it is recognised. We will support practical actions to promote good practice.

WE PLEDGE TO USE THE POWERS GRANTED TO US IN OUR ROLES AS ELECTED PUBLIC SERVANTS on Parish, Town, District and County Councils to ensure that council policies and services contribute actively towards promoting inclusion and representation, whilst reducing inequality, racism and discrimination.
